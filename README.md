# TRAINERS
Honesty, I really don't know the name of the app so, I'm gonna go with
trainers.


## RUN THE APP
- [First of all, install the expo client for running the app in dev mode on iOS or android](https://expo.io/)

- Clone the project and cd into it

- Run the commands below:

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

- Open the expo app installed on your phone and scan the QR code generated on the screen.


### NEXT STEPS
start by creating the screens for the project.
Make any changes to the screens that are necessary for the project.
